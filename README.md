# Personal Portfolio
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React.js framework, my portfolio site (henryfellerhoff.com) was built with the goal of being functional and responsive yet unique, helping me to gain proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Animations are accomplished using the react-spring library.
